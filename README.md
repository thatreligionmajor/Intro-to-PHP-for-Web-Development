### Description
In this course you'll learn everything you need to know about PHP for Web Development.

PHP powers most of the Internet, and using it is much easier than many other programming languages. 

PHP is completely free to use, and you'll be up and running and building cool web apps in minutes. 

In this course, I'll walk you through the PHP language itself.  You'll learn computer programming fundamentals like:

- Variables

- Math Operators

- Comparison Operators

- If/Else Statements

- Arrays

- Loops

- Functions

- And more!

We'll also learn how to set up an online development environment where you can write your code, and learn all about version control using git and github.

I'll also show you how to host websites for free on the popular Heroku web hosting platform.

PHP is an incredibly useful skill to have, and learning has never been easier!  I'll see you inside!
